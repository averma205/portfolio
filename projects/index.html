	<h3>SDSU Big Data Hackathon</h3>
	<p>Our team won second place in the 2024 Big Data Hackathon, sponsored by Sharp HealthCare, whose theme was “Enhancing Healthcare’s Digital Front Door”. We designed a working app prototype which aimed to build healthy habits in children from marginalized communities which could be integrated into the existing Sharp HealthCare app.</p>
